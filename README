Software to explore distributions of concepts (as defined by the Samuels Tagger) .

Core functionality is stored in SamuelsCorpus.py (which calls on functions in CharacterisingFunctions to determine distinguishing concepts)

SamuelsProcessor.ipynb is the interface which should be run first just once - this will add grammatical annotations (using Spacy) to the Samuels output, extract co-occurrence features and compute PPMI.

SamuelsViewer.ipynb relies on the results of the Processor, but can be used to explore distributions of concepts in a single corpus or across corpora.
